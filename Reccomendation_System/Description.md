# Movie Reccomendation System

This project involves using **K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm based Collaborative Filtering** to reccomend movies based on ratings.

**Dataset :** https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/

The algorithm I have used for this project are : 

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors:** In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric method proposed by Thomas Cover used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. 

2. **Collaborative Filtering:** It is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user.

## Findings

The K-Nearest Neighbours gives us a good reccomendation based on given test scenarios.
