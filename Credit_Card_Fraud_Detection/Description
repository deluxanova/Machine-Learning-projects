# Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this machine learning project, I have used Machine Learning to predict if a particular transaction is fraudulent or not.
**Dataset :** https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/

The algorithms I have used for this project are : 

1. **Isolation Forest:** Isolation forest is an unsupervised learning algorithm for anomaly detection that works on the principle of isolating anomalies, instead of the most common techniques of profiling normal points.

2. **Local Outlier Factor:** In anomaly detection, the local outlier factor is an algorithm for finding anomalous data points by measuring the local deviation of a given data point with respect to its neighbours.

3. **Support Vector Machine:** In machine learning, support-vector machines are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.

## Findings
The Isolation Forest algorithm gives us the best accuracy(99.7%) in this particluar scenario compared to Local Outlier Factor(99.6%) and Support Vector Machines(70%).
